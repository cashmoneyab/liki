**liki project**

lil thing im working on, its a open-source way to pause and resume code in roblox! 
But i've implemented a way to pause physics, animations, tweens, and sounds.
and the "likiPlugin" to your local plugins folder _("if it doesn't work, rename it to 'likiPlugin.lua')_

from there its pretty easy to understand.
you can change the interpreter to the one that actually works with your compiler.

anyhow, thats how it works.
check the "pausePlay" module for the API details

btw this was meant for luauCeption, but you can use LuauInLuau instead since that one actually works
